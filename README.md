# SSea-Legacy-Yacht
The Source code for the [Legacy Yacht mod for Sunless Sea](https://www.nexusmods.com/sunlesssea/mods/35)

Massive thanks to Desblat on the [Failbetter Discord](https://discord.gg/WUMszad7MZ) for helping me with the code!

When you complete [The First Curator's quest](http://sunlesssea.fandom.com/wiki/The_First_Curator#The_First_Curator.27s_Manse) in Venderbight, your captain can obtain the [Steam Yacht](http://sunlesssea.fandom.com/wiki/Deeds_to_a_Steam_Yacht). This mod makes it so your next captains in your lineage can also obtain the Yacht.

Fully compatible with [Ship Storage](http://www.nexusmods.com/sunlesssea/mods/12) (Including the [Sunless Stories](https://www.nexusmods.com/sunlesssea/mods/21) version).
